    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>schnitzels can be also made healthier, if you just use spelt flour instead of wheat and instead of breadcrumbs you wrap it in cornflakes. and let them bake in the oven to skip the unhealthy frying in a pan. sounds good? ٩(｡•́‿•̀｡)۶</p>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <p>for 4 servings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>500g chicken breast</li>
        <li>50g whole grain spelt flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>50ml of milk</li>
        <li>60g cornflakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>steps</h2>
    <p>for 4 servings</p>
    <ol>
        <li>preheat the oven to 180°C</li>
        <li>clean, wash and cut the chicken breast into slices. prepare three plates - put whole grain flour in one, beat eggs with milk and a pinch of salt in the second and crumble the cornflakes in the third with your hands. coat each slice first in flour, then in egg and finally in cornflakes.</li>
        <li>place the slices on a tray lined with baking paper, put in the oven, lower the temperature to 170°C and bake for 20-25 minutes.</li>
        <li>check the schnitzels before serving - take the thickest piece and cut it in half. if the meat is still pink in the middle, put it in the oven for a few minutes.</li>
